### Important:

Create a model for parsing jason
Parse jason and display the data on the screen
Transfer all network work to the NetworkManager class
## Note 1

The jason parsing method must have at least one required parameter with a closure side. When calling a method in a view controller in a closure block, an instance of the model (an array of instances) must be returned, the property values ​​of which must be passed to the corresponding interface elements. This is called asynchronous data transfer from the network manager to the view controller.

## Note 2

For asynchronous data transfer and error handling on network requests, you can use the Result type (optional).
